You can play the movie from the camera directly to your TV and at the camera stop each frame if you wish... at 60 fps you see lots of detail.\nWith Photoshop Elements (from 2.0 to the new 5.0, Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro) and this camera the creative things to do are limited only by your imagination!

    "Pros": "I'm very happy with this camera for both still pictures and the movies you can make with it!\nThe movie mode has many settings to choose from. The 320X240 at 60fps is nice for seeing such motions as a golf swing or for checking out your tennis forehand, backhand or serve. You can play the movie from the camera directly to your TV and at the camera stop each frame if you wish... at 60 fps you see lots of detail.\nWith Photoshop Elements (from 2.0 to the new 5.0, Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro) and this camera the creative things to do are limited only by your imagination! The FREE 1GB card Newegg included made this purchase an easy one to decide to make. Overall I'm very pleased!",

    "Pros": "In all but the most inhospitable lighting conditions, the camera takes fantastic pictures. When you're in a hurry, the automatic snapshot does a great job of gaugeing the lighting conditions and making the proper adjustments for a good picture. If you're not satisfied with that, you can adjust everything manually. Noise in dark shots is generally diminutive.",

    "Pros": "Lots of features for a camera in this price range.\n\nReady to take a pic in ~1 sec from power-off state!  Great for moments that you would otherwise miss on cameras that take 5 seconds or so to start up.\n\nPicture browsing on the camera is really nice you can zoom out to see a page of pics instead of 1 at a time.  Can also see a histogram to check if you may need to retake the pic.\n\nPic/movie playback to TV",

Very easy to use, the controls are laid out very nicely. Great use of features, I can go into all the advanced features and create fantastic photography, and if my mother needs to use a camera she goes onto the auto settings and still produces a fantastic image.",
