    "Cons": "I seem to detect a warmer, richer, deeper, more complex image from my Canon (SD780), but no sharper.  I've had 5-6 Canons, and this is my first Panasonic, so I may be biased.",
    "Pros": "FH8 still has generous zoom (5X) if not comparable to the SZ1 or ZS20. Moreover, it's tested out just slightly ahead of the SZ1 in terms of movies and lag time.  Significantly, the SZ1, which was pegged at a price between the FH8, is now falling to the same level (and even below) as the FH8.",
    "Comments": "I may raise my rating after a couple more months.  Though bigger (appreciably) in size, it's lighter in weight than my tiny (practically) invisible Canon SD780.  So it \"seems\" more plastic and mass-produced--which has nothing to do with performance.",
