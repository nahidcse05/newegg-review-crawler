You'll need to buy an extra hard drive or 2 to store your images. It has slow burst speed of only 3.9 fps so this camera is not that good for action shots.",
    "Pros": "This is the best full frame camera for the money. It's been out for quite sometime now and it still holds up very well with the new ones that just came out this year. 21 MP RAW is awesome. You can post process the sh*1 out of them. Has very good low light ISO. You can probably shoot up to 1600 ISO with minimal noise. Very good build. It's weather sealed so you can take pictures in the mother natures elements, but I did hear that it doesn't work too well in the freezing cold.",
    "Comments": "I think I should have bought the Nikon D800 instead. It's only 1K more than this, but I had too much glass for Canon. The 5Dmiii is not worth the extra money. The major improvement is the auto focus system and better ISO. If you're brand new to photography....go with Nikon. They have better cameras and better and cheaper glass. I'll stick with Canon for a couple more years to see if they do anything to rival Nikon.\n\nAlso, you're new best friends will be Photoshop and Lightroom. Get to know them well.",

One benefit of the DSLR is its shallow depth of field, which for film making, is a great plus.  But which camera would serve you best?  The problem with DSLR's is that they are NOT made for video; it has been a nice side effect and with firmware updates, Canon has made the video abilities more firm, but it's essentially still not a video camera.

    "Pros": "This is the best full frame camera for the money. It's been out for quite sometime now and it still holds up very well with the new ones that just came out this year. 21 MP RAW is awesome. You can post process the sh*1 out of them. Has very good low light ISO. You can probably shoot up to 1600 ISO with minimal noise. Very good build. It's weather sealed so you can take pictures in the mother natures elements, but I did hear that it doesn't work too well in the freezing cold.",
    "Comments": "I think I should have bought the Nikon D800 instead. It's only 1K more than this, but I had too much glass for Canon. The 5Dmiii is not worth the extra money. The major improvement is the auto focus system and better ISO. If you're brand new to photography....go with Nikon. They have better cameras and better and cheaper glass. I'll stick with Canon for a couple more years to see if they do anything to rival Nikon.\n\nAlso, you're new best friends will be Photoshop and Lightroom. Get to know them well.",
