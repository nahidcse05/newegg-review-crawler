    "Cons": "Its face tracking is a bit poor. Some sony cameras will pick out 5 faces easily, this one struggles with one, but with straight on pictures can get two or three. Under anything but a straight on portrait it wont get the face recognition, however its default center focus function works fine anyways. The HD-Video  (720p) resolution lost sync with audio, i think its probably because my memory card isn't fast enough and i need a better one.",
    "Pros": "Optical Image Stabilizer makes this camera easy for anyone with the shakiest hands, A feature missing on the cheaper kodaks. Way better than a digital stabilizer. Beautiful Display, fast reaction times, great night shots, manual mode is easy and fun. Takes AMAZING videos with video optical zoom, and the stabilizer works during video mode too!",
    "Comments": "The 640x680 video is smooth and the sound is great. It takes better video than my Sony Digital Handycam that I payed $500 for a few years ago.\n\nFor the price nothing can beat it. I can take over 300 pictures on one lithium CRV-3 Battery. I paid $50 more for mine, its a steal at this price.",

    "Pros": "Good glass lens- excellent.\nManual controls available when desired.\nGreat pictures in Automatic mode.",
    "Comments": "I actually own the older Z710 model.  They keep improving it, mainly by adding more megapixels.  Look for the 'Z' in the part number.  \nThis is an excellent camera to learn on while taking great prictures.  Later, if you want to, you can move up to a DSLR camera, but you will still want to keep this one.",

How good could the image stablize be..I took a picture of my 5 year old running, while shaking my hands hard and fast and she still came out crystal clear.  This camera has loads of options and I am looking forward to testing and experimenting with each of them.",
