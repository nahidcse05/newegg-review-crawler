    "Cons": "Only that I do not fully understand all its uses yet",
    "Pros": "Where to begin? I love this camera. Great entry level camera for any photographer looking for a great DSLR. I did not buy mine here, but own the same camera. Came with 18-55 and 55-200 Nikkor lens. MF/AF are on both the lenses. Enjoy the manual modes on camera. Shutter speed up to 1/4000 of a second is good for shooting in extremely sunny conditions, and has a long exposure for those dark shots too.",
    "Comments": "I take a lot of surfing photography. The 200mm lenses is perfect from the beach. With the 10mp I can crop away, right to their face and the picture is still clear. I also have a picture on my wall. 30\"x20\". Clear as it was on my computer. I recommend buying high speed SDHC for anyone looking for sports photography. The quicker it goes to the card rather than stay on the cameras que the better.",

    "Cons": "There is no auto-focus motor on the body, therefore the camera cannot auto-focus if you aren't using a lens with an integrated motor such as the Nikon AF-I or AF-S lens. This isn't really a problem since they're really nice lenses, and with Nikon's VR (vibration reduction) technology, there's really nothing to dislike about them. Just something to keep in mind if you plan to shop further.",
    "Pros": "The body is awesome. Really simple, intuitive interface. Usable for both beginner and expert. The sensor is really nice. Photos are crisp and the color is rich. The lens is excellent for a consumer grade lens. You really can't get a better bang for the buck. The body feels like it was meant to be held, you're not holding the camera as much as it is an extension of your hand. There's no contorting to get to commonly used controls.",
    "Comments": "I chose the d40x over the Canon EOS 400D (rebel XTI) because the lens that ships with the Nikon is much nicer. Initially the lack of lens variety was a detractor, however the research I did suggested that the d40x shipped with a better lens. This proved true. I've been so impressed with it that even if given the choice, I'd still buy and use Nikon's line of lenses.",
