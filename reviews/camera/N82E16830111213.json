I would not normally mention ease of operation but my three year old actually uses this camera. Hard to find anything in this price range that is water proof. I thought the trade off for a water proof camera would be accepting a lower image quality. However, this camera takes a pretty good picture. If you have a pool or are going to the beach then this is a must have camera. You do not have to worry about sand, water, or dirt. If you own an Olympus already, you will know exactly how to use this camera. Underwater picture open up a whole new world.",

I wanted rugged, waterproof, compact & capable of unlimited 640x480x30fps video with sound as we go rafting, to the water park, etc and movie clips of good times are a must with us. The earlier Olympus SW series didn't meet all my requirements but the new 1030SW looked very promising, especially with the firmware update that allows for unlimited video when using the Olympus M+ xD memory card. \nBottom line: If your emphasis is on rugged/waterproof & small enough to take anywhere then seriously consider this camera. Pics aren't DSLR quality but then it's not made to compete w/DSLR's and the handiness, ruggedness & video capabilities more than make up for pic quality for my needs. If it had an optical viewfinder I'd give it a 5 in spite of the proprietary battery, adapter & memory card.",
