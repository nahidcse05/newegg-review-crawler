    "Cons": "The con is for the product description, not the lens itself. The auto-focus (AF) doesn't work with my NIkon D5100 camera. This isn't noted in the product description. From another seller's website in bold, large font:\n\nNote! AF not supported by D40,D40X, D60, D3000 & D5000 cameras.\n\nI probably would not have bought this lens if I knew the AF didn't work with my camera.",
