I never really like the picture quality which has really bad white balance The  display went bad on the first one just out of warranty and it cost more to repair than to buy another.

I bought all three of these because of the reviews I read here. Research further. This is not a quality camera in my experience. I will not buy another Canon.",

The picture delay is slow it can take up to about 2.5 seconds before you can take another picture.",

    "Comments": "THIS CAMERA IS **GREAT** ON BATTERIES, the people that have been on here saying it eats them up do not know what they are talking about, YOU CANT PUT REGULAR BATTERIES in a digital camera.  I use the RAYOVAC 15 minute rechargables, and im getting about 200 pictures without the flash, and about 100 with the flash.",
