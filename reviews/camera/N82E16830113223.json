    "Cons": "It's kind of heavy compared to a D80 or D90.  Definately has more bulk and I will likely get tired of holding it taking action pictures 8 hrs a day.",
    "Pros": "Continuous Focus (big plus), Dual card (CF and SD), 51 point af system, 7fps, fully customizable menu, self cleaning image sensor, metering located on top and info button to display all settings on the LCD, live view, great button layout for making every adjustment you may need to do on the fly.  Uses the standard En-EL3e battery that is shared with other models (D80, D90).  This purchase will more than pay for itself, provided you have a photography business.",
    "Comments": "I bought this for my business and do not regret it.  Waited to write this review until I broke it in for a few days. Seems to be the perfect fit for sports/action photography with dual card, 7fps, ISO 6400 equiv.  This may not be the ideal camera for a hobbyist/amateur, as there are lower priced alternatives (D5000) to this one.  I needed a high fps without the additional bulk of the MB-D10 to get 7+fps and did not need an FX frame which would sacrifice zoom and was willing to sacrifice the D700's high ISO sensitivity to save a grand.  Thus I bought this instead of the D700.  I only hope this camera will attain the 3000+ images (without using the built in flash) my D80's did with this same battery.",
