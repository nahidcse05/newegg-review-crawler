    "Comments": "After using Canon P/S for decade plus, I switched to Olympus.  Glad I did.  Love this little camera.  Images clean at higher ISO's.  You can use auto iso for quick pics without fear.  Good interface on screen.  Decent feature set.\nGet yourself spare batteries, cable, and a charger, and your all set.",
