    "Pros": "Bought the camera about a month ago and have already used it on longer shoots.  I did a lot of research before buying it: it was between a canon sd600 or this fuji.  I chose this mainly because it was cheaper than the canon and because the reviews were glowing.  And they were true!  The camera is fantastic in almost every regard.  \n1. It takes excellent pictures in low and very low light conditions.  The ISO goes up to 3200!  \n2. You can set aperture, ISO etc manually if you want to, but I found that the automatic mode takes great pictures in most conditions (see below).  \n3. You can make movies with audio, and the quality is not bad.  \n4. The battery is great!  We've used the camera for about 2 weeks and it is still showing a full charge.",

I didn't want to buy another camera with an xD card (had a fuji before that was great and an olympus that took horrible pictures inside) but I can't praise this camera enough!  (I've recently seen other people taking pictures and how awful their shots looked on their ccd compared to our little camera) - so you won't regret buying it.",

    "PurchaseMark": true,
    "Cons": "The cover over the USB and charger plug-in is very clumsy & flimsy to work with. It probably will eventually break off and be lost.",
    "Pros": "Great camera. This is my 4th digital and a backup for my Fuji S7000. I needed a small camera to carry in my vest pocket when in the field collecting rocks, minerals, gems, and relics. \n\nI was amazed at the performance and the quality of the photos. I did not think I could get this from such a small package. Also, I did a lot of videos while in the field this weekend. The sound and picture quality was great. \n\nI recommend this product.",

    "Comments": "We also use the camera to shoot videos, and with a 1mb xD card, it shoots almost 16 minutes of highest resolution video footage...very nice added feature.",

    "Cons": "1. xD card - slower, more expensive and proprietary\n2. takes somewhat ok pictures when lots of light in automatic mode (but play with the manual settings and/or the scenes and you'll get them bright and crisp)\n3. it doesn't have \"anti-shake\" or real stabilization - however, because you'll need it mostly in low light, with a range of iso of 3200, you don't need to think about it too much; plus, there is a setting that acts as a stabilization mode\n4. ergonomically: it's not as thin, although not bad, and the usb cover is a bit difficult to open but come on, these are details that should be overlooked in light of all the pros",
    "Pros": "Bought the camera about a month ago and have already used it on longer shoots.  I did a lot of research before buying it: it was between a canon sd600 or this fuji.  I chose this mainly because it was cheaper than the canon and because the reviews were glowing.  And they were true!  The camera is fantastic in almost every regard.  \n1. It takes excellent pictures in low and very low light conditions.  The ISO goes up to 3200!  \n2. You can set aperture, ISO etc manually if you want to, but I found that the automatic mode takes great pictures in most conditions (see below).  \n3. You can make movies with audio, and the quality is not bad.  \n4. The battery is great!  We've used the camera for about 2 weeks and it is still showing a full charge.",
    "Comments": "It's a great camera.  I didn't want to buy another camera with an xD card (had a fuji before that was great and an olympus that took horrible pictures inside) but I can't praise this camera enough!  (I've recently seen other people taking pictures and how awful their shots looked on their ccd compared to our little camera) - so you won't regret buying it.",

    "Cons": "A compact this good means the Nikon D70 won't be coming out of it's spot on the shelf nearly as often!",
    "Pros": "After reading glowing reviews of the F30 at sites like dpreview and dcresource I was prepared to be impressed by the camera, but after a fair amount of use and testing the camera exceeded my expectations.  The low light performance and battery life are great, as advertised, but its ease of use and responsiveness make it something the whole family can pick up without spending a second looking at the manual, and they can produce great photographs and movies.",

    "Comments": "If you are looking for a camera that is almost the same quailty as a SLR then look no farther,ever review I have looked at puts this camera number 1 excepically in low light conditions,If you are just a point and shoot person or a person that likes to set controls manually then you will love this camera.there are cheaper cameras out there ,but you will not get the same quailty ,I have not seen many camers that can take a decent picture at ISO 1600.",
