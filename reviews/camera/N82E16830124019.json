    "Comments": "I'm no expert in photography, for me anything above 3MP already lets me print my pictures in the 6x4 format. This camera is very simple to use, with a very well designed menu system. The picture and movie qualities seemed excellent to me. The camera is solidly built, and surprisingly fast. Other than a greater zoom, I don't see anything missing from this camera at the point-and-shoot level.",

    "Comments": "I wish I had purchased this camera sooner... the money I spent on another seems wasted now that I know the incredible quality available in a Casio!",
