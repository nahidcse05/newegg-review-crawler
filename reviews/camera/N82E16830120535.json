    "Pros": "This is just to alert those of you who are looking for higher image quality than the usual point and shoots.  This camera has the larger 1/1.7\" sensor rather than the 1/2.3\" sensor that is used in most other Canon powershots.\n\nI have the Canon G-9 that also uses the 1/1.7\" sensor.  It takes noticeably better lower noise photos than my regular point and shoot Canon with smaller sensor.  \n\nNow, the G-9 is a few years old at this time, so there could have been a lot of advances made in that time.  But I believe that there is still a noticeable difference.  \n\nI think that the newer G models use the 1/1.7\" sensor still, except for the newest $800 G1X that uses a big 1\" sensor almost as big as the DSLR cameras use that cost thousands.",
    "Comments": "Check out the reviews on Dpreview which are the lead camera critics available.  Also, don't go by megapixels as a guide to quality in a compact camera, after they got past 10mp, it is pretty useless to go higher in a point and shoot.  The better cameras at a low price now go for 10-12 mp with a reduction in noise being the prime feature.",
