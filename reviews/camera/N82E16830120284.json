So it's hard to complain.",

Image stabilization really works; a handheld 1/8 second exposure I made inadvertently (didn't realize flash was turned off) came out crisp and clear. The many scene modes are very useful, and come close to compensating for the camera's lack of full manual control (see Cons, below). Display options are numerous and useful, especially the optional grid lines, which help keep the picture level as well as a reminder of the rule of thirds. The 28mm equivalent wide angle lens is a must for anyone who does architectural or interior shooting.",
