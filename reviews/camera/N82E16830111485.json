    "Comments": "I wanted a waterproof camera with HD video and geotagging. I did some research, saw this was coming out and waited months for this camera to be released.\n\nI should have bought the Panasonic that came out a week later. This shoots HD video at 720. The Panasonic is 1080. Video quality is ok, but a bit disappointing. Not much better than my non-HD point and shoot and nowhere near my SLR.\n\nImage quality is solid under water, but on land it's \"ok\" at best. This camera is 14 megapixel, but my 5 megapixel phone and 5 year old 7MP Sony Cybershot easily best the image quality most of the time. Shady and bright areas in photos lead to very bad results.\n\nThis is probably due to the waterproof lens.\n\nThe GPS is VERY slow to lock on, if it locks at all. In an open field, stationary, pointing up, on a clear day, the battery will die shortly after you get a GPS lock. You need to leave the camera on after it locks. Stupidly, enabling GPS also disables LCD power saving feature, killing it even",
