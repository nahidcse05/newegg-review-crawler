Only falt I give it is the plastic body, doesnt feel tough.   The price is comming down due to the Canon Rebel XT (350D) anounced in February",

Don't forget to get a 256 or better compact flash card when you buy the camera because it comes with no card at all. As usual newegg will not let you down.",

    "Comments": "This is definately a consumer level camera, but not one to be scoffed at for that reason.  Depending on what you need it for, this camera is just as good as the 10D.  Main perk to buying the 10D is that it's more professional, and has a Magnesium Alloy body, which is worth quite a bit.  \n\nBut for what you'd pay, the Rebel is a fine camera.  And since newegg sells it about $xxxx cheaper than retail, this is the place to get it.  Plus I've never had a bad experience with their shipping.  Always fast and efficient.  Checkmate.",
