    "Cons": "Doesn't come with a lithium battery, so you'll have to swap out AA's from time to time, and the automatic setting doesn't take pictures in the dark very well - some blur will occur without a stand.",
    "Pros": "Excellent for amateur or vacation photography. Over 600 pictures at max resolution with a 2gig memory stick, and extremely good quality. Easy to understand menu and selection wheel. Movies are easy to take also, and reasonable quality - good for a youtube director.",
    "Comments": "This camera has a very good price considering the quality that you get with it. With manual settings, quality in taking dark pictures could probably be improved, but my understanding was limited while taking them, and I didn't have the time for the photos I needed to take then. I would and have recommended it to friends.",
