    "Pros": "Excellent battery life, super-fast start-up time! Shot over 300 pictures at a wedding and didnt even use half the battery life. HUGE display at 2.5\"! Manual features appreciated - great user interface describes what each mode is used for. Video works well with good quality.",
    "Comments": "I have suggested this digital camera to many other people. Sony has been in this market for a while and has seemed to work out many kinks of previous models. Other than the easily-scratched screen, it is very simple to use with GREAT battery life and FAST speeds!",
