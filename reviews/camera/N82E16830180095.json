This is definately a great point and shoot camera for people who don't want to read the manual. If you do read the manual I'm sure there are plenty of advanced features for you. The scene funtion automatically sets up the settings for that type of situation and voilla--perfect picture. I would say battery life is better than AAs for a zoom style camera.

    "Pros": "10x optical, wide-angle, anti-shake. The wide-angle is the heat. I took a trip to Hawaii and did a lot of sightseeing. The camera took awesome pictures with the idiot settings. I was able to take great pictures from a moving car with the anti-shake feature. Did I say that the wide angle was great? The 10x zoom produce clear, crisp and bright pictures. Shots of people produced near perfect skin tones. I found myself taking pictures of everything because the 2GB memory card I bought held so much. The camera was easy to operate and fun to use. How about that wide-angle!! There is also the ability to preset 2 different setting in the SCN1 and SCN2 dial settings. This came in handy when I rapidly switch from people to landscape modes. I also used a small tripod with the camera for group shots. Reviewing pictures was simple and effective on the camera, although it was better to upload it to my laptop to view the pictures there. The resolution and the clarity showed better on the large screen",
    "Comments": "The anti-shake on this camera is superior to the anti-shake on the Nikon L12 I recently bought. The L12 used a high ISO like 800 or more while this camera appears to be using something more in the ISO 100 range. There was no appreciable drop in picture quality using this feature.",

Set the MPix to 5mp and you get 12x, set the MPix to 3mp and you can go to 15x optical max.  That is an effective range of: 28mm to 280mm at 10x, 333mm at 12x, and 420mm at 15x.  I have been able to easily print 3mp images to 12 x 18 after simply converting them in photoshop with 240dpi and saving as a tif image (jpeg max12 works ok too.).",

Shutter lag is not as noticable as my other digital. I push the button and the photo is done in less than a second. No more blurry photos.",
    "Comments": "I purchased an 8GB SDHC card and it worked fine. The bonus for this camera is the video feature. With the 8GB card I can record a 200min video. Make sure you get a High Speed SDHC card. The manual says 10MBps write speed is the minimum for recording videos without stuttering.",

    "Cons": "lens protection fragile, no zoom in video record mode. Some rough handling in my backpack caused the lens protection leaves to get out of sync, exposing the lens. I turned the camera off and on and that resolved the issue.",
    "Pros": "10x optical, wide-angle, anti-shake. The wide-angle is the heat. I took a trip to Hawaii and did a lot of sightseeing. The camera took awesome pictures with the idiot settings. I was able to take great pictures from a moving car with the anti-shake feature. Did I say that the wide angle was great? The 10x zoom produce clear, crisp and bright pictures. Shots of people produced near perfect skin tones. I found myself taking pictures of everything because the 2GB memory card I bought held so much. The camera was easy to operate and fun to use. How about that wide-angle!! There is also the ability to preset 2 different setting in the SCN1 and SCN2 dial settings. This came in handy when I rapidly switch from people to landscape modes. I also used a small tripod with the camera for group shots. Reviewing pictures was simple and effective on the camera, although it was better to upload it to my laptop to view the pictures there. The resolution and the clarity showed better on the large screen",
    "Comments": "The anti-shake on this camera is superior to the anti-shake on the Nikon L12 I recently bought. The L12 used a high ISO like 800 or more while this camera appears to be using something more in the ISO 100 range. There was no appreciable drop in picture quality using this feature.",

    "Cons": "Battery life wasnt amazing, a fully charged battery last about 2 hours of continuous use i.e. large display being on taking pics here and there. Probably better than traditional AA's but wasnt impress by any measure, this doesnt really take away from the overall rating i gave it, just a warning that and investment in an addtional battery isnt a bad idea.",
    "Pros": "Great camera. Plenty of features, more options then i would ever need. Takes very stable pics. At 65 mph my wife was taking pics during a road trip and they all came out very clear. depending on settings you can take pics instantly or with a bit of lag you get a better quality pic. For a non-pro i would have to say this camera offers a little bit of everything.",

    "Cons": "TZ1 had zoom during video recording and the lens barrel did not have to zoom out when turned on which allowed me to leave it turned on in my vest pocket for very fast candid shots.  I have to turn the power on/off with the TZ3 to get a candid this way... I hope the on/off switch was tested for thousands of on/off cycles otherwise....?",
    "Pros": "3in screen, 7mp, 1250 max iso, improved anti-shake from TZ1.\nVideo quality in QVGA is amazing plus you get std VGA option also.  28mm wide is actually VERY GOOD!  Should really help out realestate agents and gives me another reason not to miss using the Nikon D70 with my 12-24 lens (equiv 18-36mm).  THIS CAM HAS LOTS OF FLEXIBILITY AS A \"COMPANION\" CAMERA FOR ALL PHOTO ENTHUSIASTS!",
    "Comments": "TZ1 and TZ3 both have a very interesting feature to increase 10x optical to 15x optical max on the TZ3.  Set the MPix to 5mp and you get 12x, set the MPix to 3mp and you can go to 15x optical max.  That is an effective range of: 28mm to 280mm at 10x, 333mm at 12x, and 420mm at 15x.  I have been able to easily print 3mp images to 12 x 18 after simply converting them in photoshop with 240dpi and saving as a tif image (jpeg max12 works ok too.).",

    "Cons": "USB 1.1 transfer speeds, not a big deal as I use a card reader to conserve battery. Cannot zoom while recording video.",
    "Pros": "28-280mm lens and it fits in your back pocket. Photos come out great at both ends of the focal length. Has enough modes that their really ist a need for manual mode and a majority of the TZ-3 users would not use manual anyway. I have used it in all situations from indoor at parties, outdoor and in arena's and have produced images that could only be rivaled by a DSLR. Did I mention it fits in my back pocket when im done? Try doing that with a DLSR and a 28-280mm lens. Controls are layd out easily. On/Off switch means you dont have to hold it down a second to get the camera to turn on.",
    "Comments": "Manual mode burried somewhere in the menu would be nice for those who want it. 10X zoom kind of misleading as most of the time you are basing the multiplier by 35mm. Most 10x cameras (including the father of this one the TZ-1) are 35-350mm. However the wide angle between 28-34mm is far more usefull in my opinion than the 281-350mm range you loose.",

    "Pros": "Great camera for traveling when you don't want to lug around a large SLR-style camera. If you like to take your camera with you during your outdoor activities, this is the camera for you. \nThere is enough variety of modes for straightforward operation. User interface is very friendly. Zoom lens with 28mm offers great flexibility in shooting. Overall, taking pictures can be pretty fun with this camera.",
