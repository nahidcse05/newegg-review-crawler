    "Pros": "Great starter kit for the price.  New(grey market).  Cannot complain at this price.  It is Nikons best DSLR to date.  Not counting the full frame D600 of course.",
    "Comments": "I bought this because I finally decided to make the move to digital.  No complaints.  Everything arrived on time and in order.  The add ons are cheap and flimsy but Im not complaining.  For the price who could.  I suppose if the camera dies after the 30days ill be dealing with how to repair.  Other than that I really will be enjoying this!!",
