I can't think of anything she's wanted to do but couldn't due to a limitation of the camera. I'm half tempted to get one for myself just to have in the car.",

It's definitely not DSLR quality you don't quite have the control that you would, but then again, it doesn't cost anywhere near what a DSLR would and it is a LOT easier to just toss in your pocket and go. Especially if you have young children. I love this camera! I take it with me everywhere now when I don't feel like dragging the 300D around.",
