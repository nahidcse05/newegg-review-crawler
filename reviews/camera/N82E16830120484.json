    "Cons": "Very disappointed. My daughter had this camera for less than a year, approx 10 months, and it now does not turn on anymore. She called the help line to troubleshoot problems and was directed on how to reset it. However, that did not work. Paid approx $99 for the camera and the replacement warranty is $10 cheaper. I didn't get the replacement warranty because of the added expense. I now know that if a replacement warranty is going to cost that much the company doesn't have faith in their product. My daughter googled the issues with the camera and found others with the same problem. Buyer beware!!!",

Instructing the camera to under-expose by 2/3 a stop generally allows enough leeway to take reasonable natural-light-only shots indoors and outdoors (in less-than-full-sun daytime weather), but requires some post-processing work. No RAW shooting.",
    "Pros": "Reasonable price, decent pictures, decent zoom, decent manual options, pretty good battery life. Manual under/over-exposure control (which helps balance some of the cons).",
