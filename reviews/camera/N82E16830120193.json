    "Cons": "Not the greatest images in low light. Also would have liked a battery meter or maybe a %life instead of just a low battery warning. Although you can take quite a bit after the warning pops up unlike my old one where you could only take 2-3 more shots.",
    "Pros": "Very easy to use. I did own a Canon before but this one has way more features but doesn't get complicated. Never got used to my friends Samsung I used for over a month and I have only had this one a week and it feels familiar. Great pics straight out of the box. Love the video feature and the direct out means I can hook it straight to my TV to watch videos, very cool!",
    "Comments": "Great camera for the price. Just having it a week I feel like its paid for itself. Fast UPS 3 day select shipping, can't go wrong with that. Thanks Newegg!",

    "Pros": "Numerous features and photo quality found in more expensive cameras for a very reasonable price.",
    "Comments": "When I was thinking about purchasing the camera, I heard mixed reviews about the case. After holding it I can say it feels durable yet still \"plastic\"-y and light. I would prefer the comfort and stability of a more durable and denser metal case.",

    "Cons": "The memory card it comes with is only 15mb, which fills up very easily. I got a 1gb card for around $6 though, so that's no problem. Not really anything I can complain about thus far...",
    "Pros": "Easy to use, simple to use without the loss of good features. This thing can take some decent size pictures too. Price is excellent and it has a lot of items that came with it in a combo deal around the time I purchased it. Comes with a SD memory card.",
    "Comments": "I've only had it for a day and a half now. It's fun to use, and after I managed to bring myself to read the manual, I had a pretty good grip of the features and things. It comes with a wealth of information, including both Basic and Advanced user manuals in English and Spanish. I'd have to recommend it to anyone who was like me, and had little knowledge of what to look for in a camera. It's fun and easy to use, has an excellent price, too.",

    "Cons": "These are not picky, but they are cons. The memory card slot is in with the batteries. This protects it, but also makes it a bit inconvenient to get at. The thing eats batteries (like all digital cameras). I recommend getting a charger (I bought the Powerex one and it works GREAT).",
    "Pros": "This camera is really nice. The screen is larger than most cameras, which makes viewing the pictures really nice. It has face recognition. The settings are easy to learn. It auto senses which direction the camera is facing, and will automatically adjust the picture accordingly. It takes nice pictures. It's the best camera I've owned.",

    "Comments": "It's got this awesome face-detection system, so whenever you point the camera at your friends, you see boxes go around their faces, and move along with their faces.  I don't know if it really gives all hat much better of results, but it's hella cool!",
