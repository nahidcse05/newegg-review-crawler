    "Pros": "I've used 2 of these 30Ds for sports photography, and one I have well over 100,000 pictures on. When these came out the 5 frames a second is what caught my eye. I've shot low light dance performances with a 70-200 IS lens at 800-1000 ISO and sold a lot of pictures \"they where crisp and clear\" now that I'm talking about it I took 13,000 pictures in 2.5 days. Now I figured the low light..... Dancing I would have to trash half ....I kept over 10,000 pictures (and sold them too). I have shot NFL,The Masters Tour,Nascar with my 30D's. Now I have the 1D Mark III and keep a 30D as my side camera and the other 30D is in the bag as a backup",
    "Comments": "If monies an issue then Save the extra money and fine a 30D instead of the 40D and Buy a Nice Canon Lens in the focal length you need. I personal think the Quality of the lens is what makes the camera.",

    "Pros": "I have used this camera on a school newspaper for a school year, with many different lenses, and all I can say is wow.  It's image quality and responsiveness is unparalleled at this price point, and overall it's a stunning package.  The 30D has a huge screen, larger than almost any other DSLR out there, it has very easy to navigate menus.  The camera has some heft, but to its credit – it feels solid and comfortable in the hand, and makes a very pleasing shutter sound, as if it had no intention of ever falling apart.",
    "Comments": "The supplied lens with this product is just short of pathetic.  Go for the 17-85mm Canon lens with image stabilization.  It will make a lot of difference in the quality of the camera's images.  Canon is definitely superior in the \"pro-sumer\" DSLR market.",

I'm not a professional photographer, but I wanted great photos of my family and events that we attended. 1D was too much of a camera and 5D didn't have a flash which I might've needed without having too much of a builky thing around my neck wherever I went. 30D was perfect in that sense since I can be subtle but still take great pictures. My next step would definitely be 5D since most of the accessories for 30D fits 5D. (except for the battery grip) However I doubt that I'll need more camera than 30D...\n\nAlso, please spend a little more money and invest in top quality lenses. To put a cheap lense on this camera is a crime.",
