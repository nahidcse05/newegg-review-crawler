    "Cons": "Despite being a \"tough\" camera, the lens has no shutter or cap.   Nothing to protect it from casual bumps or scratches.    I started seeing tiny scratches on it after just a couple of days using it at my work.  Cameras usually always have shutters, so I don't think twice about laying it face down on a desk (it's supposed to be rugged after all...)",
    "Pros": "Decent pictures, resistant casing.  Never tested the waterproofing but it looked legit.",
    "Comments": "I didn't buy the camera here on Newegg, I found it in Source store on sale.  The pictures were... okay, but for the price I expected better.  Shadows act weird and the darks have plenty of little... I don't know what they're called (artefacts maybe?)   I find I get comparable results with my 5 megapixel cell-phone camera.\n\nI was able to return the camera with a full refund, I just wasn't satisfied with it.",
