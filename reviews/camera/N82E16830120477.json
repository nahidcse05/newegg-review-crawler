    "Cons": "The picture quality on this camera is terrible. It claims to be 16mp but that just can't be true. I compared my old 6mp camera to this one and could not see a single difference in image quality. The zoom is terrible as well. If you try to zoom and take a picture, the only thing you'll get is a blurry picture. I'm RMAing this thing.",
    "Pros": "Light, no need for AA batteries and such. Comes with recharger. Various colors to choose from?!",
