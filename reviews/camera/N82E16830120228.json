I have two professional photographers who have used my camera that agree, this is something wrong with this camera. Canon support is useless if you have a problem.  The will just blow you off until your warranty expires.  Search the web for 40D soft images and you will see what I am talking about.  This series of camera has issues.  Stay away from it.  And from what I have read, the 50D is not any better.  Do yourself a favor and buy Nikon or Sony.  Canon EOS cameras are only good if you can afford the $4000 cameras.",
