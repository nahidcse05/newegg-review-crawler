They ended up sending some extra microfiber clothes and when I brought it to their attention they said to just keep them.  \n\nI think the camera is high quality (for a point and shoot)).  The cover over the lens is nice if you keep the camera in your pocket, like I do.  It is much sturdier than I had originally anticipated.",
