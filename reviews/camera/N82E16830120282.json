Stereo mics work well and , I believe, zooms with the lens at least in some of the action videos I've shot it seems as if they have. I have video taken from across the lake, at three quarter full zoom, of some friends Ice surfing and the mikes pickup the sounds of the skates very well and it's between 1/8th and a 1/4 mile away. Shot without a tripod and the image stabilization worked incredibly well. Camera has a hot shoe (rare) and with a good flash it should take flash pictures much quicker than with the built in flash. Uses AA batteries.(a good thing.) I've done digital since the first Casios and have owned and have had die multiple cameras since. Some were great and some were so so. This one is a champ. It's full auto setting works well and full manual and and in between settings are well thought out as are the buttons their function and their placements.",

And SLR's don't do video, especially with optical zoom intact. I have pocket cameras as well but they don't compare. And to make up for this camera's short comings would take a good SLR back and several lenses and would cost thousands which I don't have to spend for fun. Some of my friends do, and have the high dollar outfits. They've used my camera and have considered this camera as a backup, the shlubs.",

Stereo mics work well and , I believe, zooms with the lens at least in some of the action videos I've shot it seems as if they have. I have video taken from across the lake, at three quarter full zoom, of some friends Ice surfing and the mikes pickup the sounds of the skates very well and it's between 1/8th and a 1/4 mile away. Shot without a tripod and the image stabilization worked incredibly well. Camera has a hot shoe (rare) and with a good flash it should take flash pictures much quicker than with the built in flash. Uses AA batteries.(a good thing.) I've done digital since the first Casios and have owned and have had die multiple cameras since. Some were great and some were so so. This one is a champ. It's full auto setting works well and full manual and and in between settings are well thought out as are the buttons their function and their placements.",
    "Comments": "This camera is small and very light compared to the SLR's with a lens or group of lenses that have a similar capability. Have you seen those? They're huge. And SLR's don't do video, especially with optical zoom intact. I have pocket cameras as well but they don't compare. And to make up for this camera's short comings would take a good SLR back and several lenses and would cost thousands which I don't have to spend for fun. Some of my friends do, and have the high dollar outfits. They've used my camera and have considered this camera as a backup, the shlubs.",

    "Cons": "F-stops are limited with this big lens. Image stabilization is excellent. A bit of fringing at it's limits but I'm not a DD (Darkroom Diva) or a PP (pixel Peeper). I shoot memories not perfection or art. Besides, if the pic is a great composition it should stand in black and white. As for lens cap tether, I bought a Cap Keeper II for a couple bucks. I would like to know how to mount filters on this thing. Slippery? Yup but I use this thing called a neck strap. As for batteries, try and get a lithium battery charged when your out in the boonies or in a foreign country. AA's are easy to find and carry. I use the reformulated NiMH that holds their charge. They work well and last.",
    "Pros": "Innumerable features. Canon does have good glass. Major plus is the silent, functional, zoom when doing video. Stereo mics work well and , I believe, zooms with the lens at least in some of the action videos I've shot it seems as if they have. I have video taken from across the lake, at three quarter full zoom, of some friends Ice surfing and the mikes pickup the sounds of the skates very well and it's between 1/8th and a 1/4 mile away. Shot without a tripod and the image stabilization worked incredibly well. Camera has a hot shoe (rare) and with a good flash it should take flash pictures much quicker than with the built in flash. Uses AA batteries.(a good thing.) I've done digital since the first Casios and have owned and have had die multiple cameras since. Some were great and some were so so. This one is a champ. It's full auto setting works well and full manual and and in between settings are well thought out as are the buttons their function and their placements.",
    "Comments": "This camera is small and very light compared to the SLR's with a lens or group of lenses that have a similar capability. Have you seen those? They're huge. And SLR's don't do video, especially with optical zoom intact. I have pocket cameras as well but they don't compare. And to make up for this camera's short comings would take a good SLR back and several lenses and would cost thousands which I don't have to spend for fun. Some of my friends do, and have the high dollar outfits. They've used my camera and have considered this camera as a backup, the shlubs.",

    "Cons": "* Every camera with a compact sensor has issues with dynamic range.  I'm not docking an egg for this because it's expected in this class of camera, but just pointing it out.  You won't get SLR performance from this.\n\n* The lens cap doesn't attach very well and has no cord to attach it to the camera, so it would be easy to lose.\n\n* No RAW mode, but you can add that yourself with the open source CHDK firmware expansion (google it...)",
    "Pros": "* Excellent set of features\n* Nice build quality\n* Uses AA batteries!  MUCH nicer than proprietary batts.  Use NiMH's, and you can bum a set of AA's off someone in a pinch.  No extra charger to keep track of.  Easy to carry spare sets, and they're far cheaper too.\n* Good optics, wide range zoom.\n* Works great with DigiKam under Ubuntu Linux (9.04).  I highly recommend this package.\n* Feels like a miniature SLR.\n* Allows total manual control over A, S, etc.",
    "Comments": "If you're really super serious you probably want to look at an SLR instead, but for more hobby and casual use, this is a great camera and takes excellent pictures.  Just no matter what camera you get, stay away from the proprietary batteries :)",

    "Comments": "Since the majority of pictures most of us take require a flash it seems that Canon would have put a little more into the built in flash - My reason for only 4 eggs. The camera does have a hotshoe so the problem is one that can be corrected with a little extra cash. Otherwise I would consider this camera to be nearly the perfect mid-priced point and shoot digital camera",
