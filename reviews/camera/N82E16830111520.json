Love the in camera effects and I printed a 16x24 from a photo my daughter took with this camera!  Great underwater as well!",

    "Comments": "The camera takes frequent blurred pictures. It takes practice to pre-focus then shoot and even then it can blur. I have 5 people  using them and we take about 2000 pictures a week. 10 to 60 percent are blurred depending on the camera and user. I love the camera but after 2 years am giving up and going to another brand. PS. We stayed with this brand for business equipment consistency reasons (same battery; learning knowledge; etc.).",
