    "Cons": "It's average quality for a compact camera.  You pay for the features, only buy this if the features sound good to you.\n\nYou still need an SLR if you want excellent photos.",
    "Pros": "WATERPROOF!!!  SHOCKPROOF!!! Pocket friendly.  Perfect for camping, beaches, canoing/tubing, bar hopping!\n\nThis is my new compact camera for parties and walking around.",
    "Comments": "I bought this for photographing my coral in my reeftank, works beautifully for getting great macro photography underwater that rivals a $1200+ setup w/ lens.  Not to mention a macro lens can never get the angles this camera can do underwater, it's magical, simply magical.",
