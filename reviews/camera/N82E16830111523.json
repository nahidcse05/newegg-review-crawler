    "Cons": "Unfortunately, co-workers dog took it off my desk and gnawed into the battery door.  Camera still works fine, but I destroyed the door opening it to charge the battery.\n\nOnly real con is that Olympus uses proprietary USB-connectors.  They look identical, but standard USB cords don't work.\n\nThere's no apparently good reason for using non-standard connectors when standard ones work fine.  Companies don't do this for the buyer's benefit.",
    "Pros": "Simple to use, compact, and durable.  \nImmediately tested by dropping from 5' onto cement floor and it was un-damaged.\nGreat ergonomics, and photos turned out fine.",
    "Comments": "I almost replaced this with an identical unit, but Newegg had the Tough 630 for sale at only a little higher price.\nI'm very happy with that one.",
