I already own a Canon SLR body with several different medium quality canon lenses and they all work great. \n\nThere are some problems with non-canon lenses, but I'm not affected by those.

The large sensor results in almost no noise in pictures taken with a low ISO setting, and even at 1600 ISO the noise is managable. \n\nDespite having a plasticy look, the camera is very stury, and with battery & lens is great. The camera will do four frames in a second, before starting to write to the CF card. This makes taking shots at one per second for extended periods not a concern. Coupled with a high speed (I got the lexar 45x from newegg) CF card it's blazing fast. Since getting the camera I've shot over 1500 frames, all coming out great. \n\nThere are some features missing that are available on the D10, but there are so many features using the creative shooting modes that all but advanced photgraphers will have plenty of control over the camera for a long time.\n\nI use this camera to print directly to an Epson rx600 and the prints are stunning up to 8x10. To see what it was capable of, I had some good shots printed at 11x14 and then again at 16x20.

The controls are quick to pick up and the learning curve is just steep enough to get you enthusiastic about taking pictures again.

She's very fussy and can't stay still for more than half a sec.  I take pictures of her one right after another.  I keep the good shots and <font>d</font>elete the bad ones.  Then, I start over, just clicking away.  I never miss a moment.\n\nThe bad...doesn't come bundled with a Coach Carrying Case.",

    "Comments": "Got this camera from Newegg last week (earlier than expected - Thanks!), and I absolutely love it.  My previous camera was a Sony DSC-S70.  This is the perfect camera for someone who has outgrown their point-and-shoot, and is ready for an SLR.  The controls are quick to pick up and the learning curve is just steep enough to get you enthusiastic about taking pictures again.  The automatic zone options provide great results and there is plenty of room to take more control of your shots in the creative zone.  I also purchased a Transcend 1 gig CF card that is fantastic - very fast write speeds.  The D-Rebel is a fantastic camera.  Thanks Newegg!",

    "Comments": "This camera is outstanding for a price/performance ratio. Don't be fooled into the megapixel war because you'll really not see any difference between 6.3 and 8 megapixels. The picture quality is outstanding (you can easily get great quality 8x10s from this). I've really enjoyed the versatility of being able to use different lenses to meet my needs and it has really opened the door to much better photography. I've been so pleased with this camera! Obviosuly, you'll want to consider investing more cash into a few other lenses down the road, but the stock 18-55mm lens will certainly suffice for the time. For me, it's been a great investment and has put a lot of great pictures on my wall. Make sure you exploit this camera's \"creative\" modes, they'll teach you a lot about photography. Definitely a great buy for those looking into a prosumer camera.",
