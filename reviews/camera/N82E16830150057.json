Press the shutter button and the camera will focus and shoot very quickly without that typical digital camera lag.  Perfect size - small enough to put in your pocket, but big enough that it is easy to hold.  The picture quality is great and the battery lasts a decent amount of time.",
    "Comments": "You definitely need the biggest media card you can afford.  I got a 1gb card and at the cameras highest setting (7.2mb on fine setting - which is the lowest compression), the card can hold 288 pictures.  You can roughly double that number by using 7.2mb but on the standard setting (higher compression).  I find that as long as I regularly transfer the images to my computer, even using the highest settings gives me plenty of storage.  If I was going on a trip and wouldn't have access to my computer, then I would probably have to increase the compression to fit more pictures on the card.",

    "Pros": "Great camera.  The response is much faster than any of the digital cameras I've used in the past.  Press the shutter button and the camera will focus and shoot very quickly without that typical digital camera lag.  Perfect size - small enough to put in your pocket, but big enough that it is easy to hold.  The picture quality is great and the battery lasts a decent amount of time.",
    "Comments": "You definitely need the biggest media card you can afford.  I got a 1gb card and at the cameras highest setting (7.2mb on fine setting - which is the lowest compression), the card can hold 288 pictures.  You can roughly double that number by using 7.2mb but on the standard setting (higher compression).  I find that as long as I regularly transfer the images to my computer, even using the highest settings gives me plenty of storage.  If I was going on a trip and wouldn't have access to my computer, then I would probably have to increase the compression to fit more pictures on the card.",

    "Comments": "Bought as a gift for my girlfriend. We were replacing a previous Sony camera, which had a faulty lens. We learned that Sony produced many of that model with the bad lens, and was not friendly about replacing/repairing them. So we felt like this was a gamble, but we have been pleased so far.",

    "Cons": "The Sony software included with the camera is junk.  In fact, it seems to be suited more to a camcorder that a digital camera.  I simply uninstalled the Sony software and use the software that came with Windows XP.  It does everything I need and is much easier to use than the Sony software.",
    "Pros": "Great camera.  The response is much faster than any of the digital cameras I've used in the past.  Press the shutter button and the camera will focus and shoot very quickly without that typical digital camera lag.  Perfect size - small enough to put in your pocket, but big enough that it is easy to hold.  The picture quality is great and the battery lasts a decent amount of time.",
    "Comments": "You definitely need the biggest media card you can afford.  I got a 1gb card and at the cameras highest setting (7.2mb on fine setting - which is the lowest compression), the card can hold 288 pictures.  You can roughly double that number by using 7.2mb but on the standard setting (higher compression).  I find that as long as I regularly transfer the images to my computer, even using the highest settings gives me plenty of storage.  If I was going on a trip and wouldn't have access to my computer, then I would probably have to increase the compression to fit more pictures on the card.",
