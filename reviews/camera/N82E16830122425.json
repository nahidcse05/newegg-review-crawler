    "Cons": "It is advertised to be sealed against sand. The inside is. However, the door locking mechanism does not like sand at all and jams right up. By the time you get the door unlocked, it is in pieces rendering the camera useless. One micro spec of plastic was holding all the tiny pieces together.",
    "Pros": "Worked as it should.",
    "Comments": "First I would like to point out that I bought this camera at Blacks Photography, not Newegg, but thought that everyone should be aware of the sand issue. It was a nice camera and worked well until a shallow sand infested wave touched it. Now it is junk.",
