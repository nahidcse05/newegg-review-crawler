    "Cons": "When you're using the touch screen you'll inevitably get smudges on the screen, just keep a microfiber cloth in handy at all times.",
    "Pros": "Amazing and I have no regrets buying it. The 18-55mm lens that comes with it works well, but you'll probably find yourself replacing it in the near future, but don't let that stop you from getting the T4i with the lens, it's still nice to have around. \n\nIf you're just entering photography and you want a high performer for a low cost, buy this DSLR.",
