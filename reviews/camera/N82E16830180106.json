    "Pros": "Leica lens. I'll repeat that, it has a Leica lens which makes all of the difference and is German designed. German glass is still the best in the world. If you are in this price range this is the camera to own. It is fantastic and the pictures are incredible. On our honeymoon many people used our FZ8 to take pictures of us and repeatedly people commented on how nice the camera took pictures. With a 2GB memory card you can record video for about 30 minutes as well. The battery lasts a long time and the software included works well. Added bonus: It works flawlessly with digiKam in Linux.",
    "Comments": "I worked as a photo re-toucher for a digital studio lab for 10 years. I've seen evolution of the digital camera and this is the one I own. Leica is one if the most respected names in photo equipment, and their lenses are professional grade. So many times people get caught up in megapixels and features (which this camera has as well), but at the end of the day the glass in front of the CCD is what counts.",

    "Cons": "Starting to get memory card errors but I haven't determined if it's the card or not. I tend to take and erase pictures often and I don't think the camera likes when the card gets fragmented.",
    "Pros": "It's hard to know where to begin but this camera is simply awesome! It was between this and the S5 and I think I made the better choice. This camera is light, smaller than you think and takes awesome shots! Start with a full charge because you'll kill the battery in about the time it takes you to try all of the stuff this camera has to offer.",
    "Comments": "I recommend keeping the manual close by for the first week or so. I'd also recommend at LEAST a 4gb SDHC card with it if you are going to do any sort of video because at 640x480 and 30fps(while the video looks absolutely amazing) it gets 10 minutes per GB.",

When I purchased this one I was surprised at how light it was and I thought the quality might be affected. It wasn't. The telephoto feature will astound you. Wait ... there's more. Put in a 2GB SD card and take movies ... full screen (480x640), without flash and with only the available light and you'll be amazed at how well they turn out. Read the manual and you'll become a pro. I took movies at an indoor western Live show ... along with stills, put them together and authored a nice DVD. Did the same at a Jazz festival .. same great results. I paid $349 for a lesser model and this latter model has to be one of the best values you can find anywhere. Amazing to me that they don't advertise more!",
    "Comments": "I take this camera everywhere .. even camping and hunting since it is so light. Even after a year I'm amazed at how easy it is to take good pictures ... and more importantly, so is my wife!",

If anybody knows the solution to this please post what it is. I read the 130 page manual and did some online research but couldn't find the answer.",
    "Pros": "My second digital, bought an Olympus six years and 10,000 snapshots ago and by the way, it's still as good as the day I bought it. Anyway, the Panasonic is working as well as I was expecting. I mainly bought it for the 12X optical zoom, which will extend to 18X if you don't max out the photo size; at least they claim it's zooming to 18X so I suppose it is. 99% of my photos are for computer viewing, I rarely print , so setting to a smaller file size was no big deal to me.  I've taken 200-300 shots with zoom and I'm quite pleased with the results. Using the zoom with macro has produce some extraordinary pix of bees and wasps sucking pollen from flowers in my backyard. I imagine hardcore camera buffs would find plenty of flaws but to an average  guy like me who wants something beyond point and shoot but is too cheap to shell out more than 300-400 bucks it's nice.",
