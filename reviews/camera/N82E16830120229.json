    "Cons": "Hot spots/stuck pixels at high ISOs, poor AI-Servo auto-focusing, takes slightly blurry pictures with super-telephoto lenses, inaccurate auto-focus with Canon's long lenses, dark viewfinder, poor battery life and slow shutter speed in low light.  If the ISO is over 400 image quality will start to degrade.\n\nThe lack of auto-focus assist points make taking pictures of birds in flight very difficult.  Auto-focus with Canon 'L' lenses is not spot on and require manual focusing for tack-sharp pictures.\n\nMy biggest gripe is the full auto 'point and shoot' mode disables almost all the menu options in the camera.",
    "Pros": "The camera has most of the features found in Canons more advanced models with a bright 3\" LCD on the back.  While it can do a lot at ISO 100 the weaknesses are hard to spot unless you have used it for six months.\n\nWith the Canon EF 100-400L this camera is good enough to photograph wildlife.  Wide angle lenses will work but don't fill the viewfinder well.\n\nThe auto-focus works for short distances and manual focusing in live-view makes tack-sharp pictures with a remote trigger.  Av and Tv mode work the best over the full auto.\n\nThe grip feels sturdy and the camera body weighs just enough to carry for several hours without wrist fatigue.",
    "Comments": "This camera is the \"Jack of all trades and the master of none\" in Canon's line-up of DSRLs.  It is a good camera but not perfect.\n\nReading the manual and mastering the controls is critical to taking good pictures as the full-auto mode disables too many useful features.",

Something with the sensor i guess.  \nI quickly researched  online, several other people have the same issues. \nGoing to send it back to newegg for exchange.",

If the ISO is over 400 image quality will start to degrade.\n\nThe lack of auto-focus assist points make taking pictures of birds in flight very difficult.  Auto-focus with Canon 'L' lenses is not spot on and require manual focusing for tack-sharp pictures.\n\nMy biggest gripe is the full auto 'point and shoot' mode disables almost all the menu options in the camera.",
    "Pros": "The camera has most of the features found in Canons more advanced models with a bright 3\" LCD on the back.  While it can do a lot at ISO 100 the weaknesses are hard to spot unless you have used it for six months.\n\nWith the Canon EF 100-400L this camera is good enough to photograph wildlife.  Wide angle lenses will work but don't fill the viewfinder well.\n\nThe auto-focus works for short distances and manual focusing in live-view makes tack-sharp pictures with a remote trigger.  Av and Tv mode work the best over the full auto.\n\nThe grip feels sturdy and the camera body weighs just enough to carry for several hours without wrist fatigue.",
    "Comments": "This camera is the \"Jack of all trades and the master of none\" in Canon's line-up of DSRLs.  It is a good camera but not perfect.\n\nReading the manual and mastering the controls is critical to taking good pictures as the full-auto mode disables too many useful features.",

    "Comments": "Make sure you get a big CF card.  I got the 8GB Extreme III and it holds about 450-500 RAW files.  Get a card reader, too.  The USB on the camera is SLOW for some reason.",

    "Cons": "The camera died with an Error 99 after only a month and a half. I had to ship it back to the manufacturer and they don't do RMA. So I'll be missing my camera when I really need it. For something this expensive you'd think Canon would have better customer service. They are going to fix it under warranty, but now I have a really expensive refurbed camera.",
    "Pros": "Great Sensor, Good color, and the RAW format imports to everything I've used so far. Using the menu is a snap. If you shoot manual you'll be impressed at how easy it is to adjust on the fly. Really large view screen. Great Camera for the price.",
    "Comments": "I do want to say that Newegg has always had stellar customer service when I buy their products. This one is all on Canon.",

    "Cons": "The highest ISO, 3200 is very noisy, almost non usable. Although, in order to use it, you have to dig in to the Cfn settings and enable it.\nThe screen is hard to see in very bright sun conditions.\nAs soon as I order it, Canon announced 50D, with more resolution, longer zoom kit lens, more ISO and better weather seal. I read the review (dpreview.com) and sample pictures look rather noisy, but judge for yourself. It's much pricier too.",
    "Pros": "Big, heavy, feels professional. Great picture quality, lots of options. Menus and controls are well placed and easy to reach. \nI specially like the continuous shooting mode, up to 6 frames per second until the buffer is full, in my case is like 13 pictures shooting raw.",
    "Comments": "I love it. The kit lens that comes with it is good for starting and all around shooting.\nWorth the money. If you want anything better you would have to go to the canon 5d (but wait for the imminent upgrade) or to the new Nikon 90D that makes movies too.",
