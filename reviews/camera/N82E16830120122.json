    "Comments": "I just got this camera today, and so far am very pleased. For the money, its a great buy. The images are clear and the options on the camera are easy to use. I am not very digital camera savvy, but the a75 is easy to use and getting the pictures onto my computer was easier than expected. As usual, newegg delivers again with excellent service and fast shipping (i received order a day early!). This won't be the last time i shop at newegg, their service is outstanding.",

Having a little trouble with battery usage but I don't know if it's the camera or faulty batteries. Ordered on Tuesday afternoon, started taking pictures less than 48 hours later! NewEgg is groovy!!!!!",

Will take 153 shots with a 256mb cf card at highest settings. Thanks Newegg for another great product and SUPERIOR service as always!",

    "Comments": "I've bought 2 of these for family members and everyone loves them. They are really easy to pick up and use but offer a lot of customization features for more advanced photographers. Canon has the best digital optics around, and this camera produces great quality photos. The bundled software has some great features too; I especially love being able to shoot the camera remotely from a PC, which is handy when taking indoor and macro shots where you don't want to move the camera a lot. The battery life is great too, you can easily fill a 256MB card before you need to swap the batteries. An overall excellent product at a great (sub-$xxx!) price.",

    "Comments": "Bought this camera a while ago. Took over 500 pictures in about a month when the camera would not work correctly. Ended up sending the camera to Canon for repairs which they quickly turned around. Have since taken hundreds of pictures (over a thousand at least) and it always goes on trips and hikes. People have been impressed with the picture quality and I like the versatility of the controls coming from 35mm SLR's. Buy the little case for the camera for convenience and protection and get some rechargeble batteries. I gave it a 4 only because of the first problems, which seem to have stayed fixed. Newegg and Canon were very good. Oh yes, the movie mode is acceptable and easy to use.",
