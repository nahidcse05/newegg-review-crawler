    "Cons": "The viewfinder is TINY!!!! T I N Y!!! I have a 5d and an a 3 and a 1v, and this viewscreen is too tiny to manually focus by! I'm an experienced pro photographer and I can't be sure of my own focus without switching to live view mode and confirming I have the subject in focus. It works fine if you shoot it on autofocus mode or if you use a consumer lens with a huge depth of field f/4+, but if you are using the prime series lenses like the 35/1.4, 50/1.4, or 100/2 you will not be able to see clearly enough to manually focus!!!\n\nThis camera is not one you want to depend on when trying to get wedding shots in a dark reception hall!\n\nSuperb picture quality, but severely hampered if you plan on doing any manual focus at all.",
    "Pros": "Superb sharpness, comfortable, durable, easy to use intuitive menus. Canon quality.",
    "Comments": "If you ever take portrait shots with a shallow DOF this isn't the camera for you!!! too small to focus!",
