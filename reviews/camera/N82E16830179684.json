    "Cons": "At 20mp shots, it's still fast but don't expect it to be as fast as 10mp camera",
    "Pros": "There is a silky smoothness to the shots that I just can't get with other digital cameras I have had.  I bought this for my daughter to take Australia but had a couple of weeks to play with it myself - I was impressed.",
    "Comments": "As I have worked for major consumer equipment manufacturers I understand what Refurbished means - you're basically buying a product that has already been through the infant mortality stages and survived, been made new, and resold at a fraction.. it's crazy that people worry about this. Yes it's possible to get one with a weird problem not caught in the (re)mfg process, but you have the same risk with a new one as often the refurbs are tested on the same or an identical line.\n\nI'm too lazy to read the manual - I was hoping there was a button that could stream it into my brain.",
