    "Cons": "Autofocus a tad slow.  Also, if you want to take a lot of quick pictures turn of the preview or you have to keep touching the focus button.  \nI would have preferred a through the lens view instead of a mini-lcd in the view finder but I am getting used to it.",
    "Pros": "Awesome pictures.  The colors are vibrant and sharp.  It has some real nice features like a 'full manual' mode for true photograpers.  \n\nGood auto-focus features for a low-priced digital camera.  \n\nThe 10X optical zoom can be intimidating because it gets you so close but the pics are sharp throughout the range of the lens.  I turned off the digital zoom because it's not needed.\n\nA wonderful replacement for my old 2MP Fuji.",

    "Comments": "I purchased this camera for my parents.  My dad is in his 70's and I wanted them to have a camera that was very easy to use.  Besides taking pictures of family they also take pictures of wildlife when they are up in the hills.  10x optical zoom at this price is just amazing.",
