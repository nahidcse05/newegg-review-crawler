    "Cons": "The 1/2.35\" CCD image sensor is relatively small and for low-light situations can produce noisy pictures if short exposures are made.\n\nFor bright daylight use, the screen is not bright enough and it’s hard to frame pictures with this camera.\n\nThe Li-50 battery is a proprietary size, expensive to replace and relatively difficult to locate.\n\nDoes not come with an xD memory card.  \n\nxD memory cards are confusing if you are not experienced.  A 2GB xD Type-M card is OK for still photography. For video capture, xD Type-H memory cards are necessary. Type-H memory cards are hard to find.",
    "Pros": "This is a very compact, rugged, water-resistant digital camera for outdoor use. This camera has a sophisticated exposure system which allows the user considerable flexibility in producing properly exposed outdoor/indoor shots. Camera is easy to use. It has menu-driven scene mode for preset exposure control, or manual mode for finer exposure control.  Camera is really optimized for daylight outdoor photography, though it is capable of producing acceptable indoor images provided the flash is used or exposure times are sufficiently long.  Color rendition and saturation is excellent.  Image resolution is excellent and on 8x10 paper with shows no noticeable granularity.\n\nOLYMPUS image processing software is provided which I found easy to use and OK. This software does a good job managing, converting and editing images from this camera. This software can convert to various image formats and resolutions. And has not slowed down or harmed my XP Home computer (not spyware/bloatware)",
    "Comments": "I am well satisfied with this camera and feel comfortable recommending this camera to friends with one caveat: this camera is not intended to replace a digital SLR camera if you want superior image quality and maximum versatility for indoor photography.\n\nThis is my first digital camera.  I am a 35 year veteran of 35mm film SLR photography. A compact digital camera took time to feel comfortable and competent.  I have owned this camera for nearly a year and have enough experience form a very positive opinion.  \n\nDigital photography beats film photography because I do not have to deal with time-consuming darkroom work.  Just download, view, crop and print the images on the PC.\n\nThis camera is definitely rugged, waterproof and can withstand cold. I use this camera outdoors on hikes or cross-country ski trips in the Adirondacks were the climate can become very cold in the winter, and very wet and humid in the summer.  Camera withstood this and functioned very well.",

On Third day I already looked for another underwater camera and did write letter to Olympus Repair Service ( 6 days ago - no answer yet). What's happened, you'll ask? Nothing :(( just a small protection shield on lens been dropped down ( clued off) when I had snorkeling on water ( no any dive been done deeper then 5-6 ft) and water from all Pacific ocean leaked into camera, because this small protection shield cloaking seal which protects electronic board. What I felt those time  - you 'll better never feel. And definitely, first idea was to write the letter to Olympus team. Probably it happened before Christmas, I got a wrong idea that Great Olympus Santa will send me another camera and I will happy like a child...But, I'll tell you a secret - there is no Santa in Olympus ( and probably in the world as well).",

It's super awesome to joke around with people and drop it in your beer or the water or something.
