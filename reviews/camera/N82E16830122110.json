The camera struggles to focus indoors and compensates by using a higher ISO. Anything over ISO 200 is pretty much useless but that's not uncommon in a point and shoot.\n\nOutdoors this camers fares infinitely better. \n\nThe bundled Fuji software is useless, I like the MS wizard much better, it's faster and doesn't automatically move the photo's into the Fuji folder (without asking) where it's much more complicated to do any adjustments or cropping.\n\nThe USB door and the battery door both seem somewhat flimsy. Time will tell.",
    "Pros": "There really are a myriad of things to like about this camera. Everything is well thought out, buttons are placed logically, numerous shooting modes, EVF, pop up flash, menu relatively easy to navigate through. When you get a great shot the detail is unparalled. \n\nTakes SD/SDHC or xD memory. I'm using an 4G SDHC card. I like being able to use AA and rechargeable NiMH batteries. Ability to shoot in color, chrome or B&W. Plenty of manual modes.\n\nMostly I like the size. It's not like trying to take a picture with a credit card which I find awkward. The grip is rubberized which makes it firm and easy to hold. Boots up and is ready to go in about 1 second. Memory card slot is separate from the battery compartment. \n\nDefinately a bang for the buck.",
    "Comments": "The macro mode is incredible, detail is better than my Lumix DMC-LZ7or Canon S5 IS. The strap design is awful, once it's on it's on, it's very diffucult to remove or adjust. Lens cap snaps on and off easily but must be attached to the strap. Where I naturally want to grip the camera with my left hand is right over the pop-up flash, guess I'll try and get used to it. \n\nI am going to keep playing with this but I'm betting I'll return it. I want to love it, so far I just can't.",

Time will tell.",
    "Pros": "There really are a myriad of things to like about this camera.

When you get a great shot the detail is unparalled. \n\nTakes SD/SDHC or xD memory. I'm using an 4G SDHC card. I like being able to use AA and rechargeable NiMH batteries. Ability to shoot in color, chrome or B&W. Plenty of manual modes.\n\nMostly I like the size. It's not like trying to take a picture with a credit card which I find awkward. The grip is rubberized which makes it firm and easy to hold. Boots up and is ready to go in about 1 second. Memory card slot is separate from the battery compartment. \n\nDefinately a bang for the buck.",
    "Comments": "The macro mode is incredible, detail is better than my Lumix DMC-LZ7or Canon S5 IS. The strap design is awful, once it's on it's on, it's very diffucult to remove or adjust. Lens cap snaps on and off easily but must be attached to the strap. Where I naturally want to grip the camera with my left hand is right over the pop-up flash, guess I'll try and get used to it. \n\nI am going to keep playing with this but I'm betting I'll return it.

Where I naturally want to grip the camera with my left hand is right over the pop-up flash, guess I'll try and get used to it. \n\nI am going to keep playing with this but I'm betting I'll return it.

Everything is well thought out, buttons are placed logically, numerous shooting modes, EVF, pop up flash, menu relatively easy to navigate through. When you get a great shot the detail is unparalled. \n\nTakes SD/SDHC or xD memory. I'm using an 4G SDHC card. I like being able to use AA and rechargeable NiMH batteries. Ability to shoot in color, chrome or B&W. Plenty of manual modes.\n\nMostly I like the size. It's not like trying to take a picture with a credit card which I find awkward. The grip is rubberized which makes it firm and easy to hold. Boots up and is ready to go in about 1 second. Memory card slot is separate from the battery compartment. \n\nDefinately a bang for the buck.",

Lens cap snaps on and off easily but must be attached to the strap. Where I naturally want to grip the camera with my left hand is right over the pop-up flash, guess I'll try and get used to it. \n\nI am going to keep playing with this but I'm betting I'll return it.

Everything is well thought out, buttons are placed logically, numerous shooting modes, EVF, pop up flash, menu relatively easy to navigate through. When you get a great shot the detail is unparalled. \n\nTakes SD/SDHC or xD memory. I'm using an 4G SDHC card. I like being able to use AA and rechargeable NiMH batteries. Ability to shoot in color, chrome or B&W. Plenty of manual modes.\n\nMostly I like the size. It's not like trying to take a picture with a credit card which I find awkward. The grip is rubberized which makes it firm and easy to hold. Boots up and is ready to go in about 1 second. Memory card slot is separate from the battery compartment. \n\nDefinately a bang for the buck.",
    "Comments": "The macro mode is incredible, detail is better than my Lumix DMC-LZ7or Canon S5 IS. The strap design is awful, once it's on it's on, it's very diffucult to remove or adjust. Lens cap snaps on and off easily but must be attached to the strap. Where I naturally want to grip the camera with my left hand is right over the pop-up flash, guess I'll try and get used to it. \n\nI am going to keep playing with this but I'm betting I'll return it.

The camera struggles to focus indoors and compensates by using a higher ISO. Anything over ISO 200 is pretty much useless but that's not uncommon in a point and shoot.\n\nOutdoors this camers fares infinitely better. \n\nThe bundled Fuji software is useless, I like the MS wizard much better, it's faster and doesn't automatically move the photo's into the Fuji folder (without asking) where it's much more complicated to do any adjustments or cropping.\n\nThe USB door and the battery door both seem somewhat flimsy. Time will tell.",
    "Pros": "There really are a myriad of things to like about this camera. Everything is well thought out, buttons are placed logically, numerous shooting modes, EVF, pop up flash, menu relatively easy to navigate through. When you get a great shot the detail is unparalled. \n\nTakes SD/SDHC or xD memory. I'm using an 4G SDHC card. I like being able to use AA and rechargeable NiMH batteries. Ability to shoot in color, chrome or B&W. Plenty of manual modes.\n\nMostly I like the size. It's not like trying to take a picture with a credit card which I find awkward. The grip is rubberized which makes it firm and easy to hold. Boots up and is ready to go in about 1 second. Memory card slot is separate from the battery compartment. \n\nDefinately a bang for the buck.",
    "Comments": "The macro mode is incredible, detail is better than my Lumix DMC-LZ7or Canon S5 IS. The strap design is awful, once it's on it's on, it's very diffucult to remove or adjust. Lens cap snaps on and off easily but must be attached to the strap. Where I naturally want to grip the camera with my left hand is right over the pop-up flash, guess I'll try and get used to it. \n\nI am going to keep playing with this but I'm betting I'll return it. I want to love it, so far I just can't.",

When you get a great shot the detail is unparalled. \n\nTakes SD/SDHC or xD memory. I'm using an 4G SDHC card. I like being able to use AA and rechargeable NiMH batteries. Ability to shoot in color, chrome or B&W. Plenty of manual modes.\n\nMostly I like the size. It's not like trying to take a picture with a credit card which I find awkward. The grip is rubberized which makes it firm and easy to hold. Boots up and is ready to go in about 1 second. Memory card slot is separate from the battery compartment. \n\nDefinately a bang for the buck.",
    "Comments": "The macro mode is incredible, detail is better than my Lumix DMC-LZ7or Canon S5 IS. The strap design is awful, once it's on it's on, it's very diffucult to remove or adjust. Lens cap snaps on and off easily but must be attached to the strap. Where I naturally want to grip the camera with my left hand is right over the pop-up flash, guess I'll try and get used to it. \n\nI am going to keep playing with this but I'm betting I'll return it. I want to love it, so far I just can't.",

Ability to shoot in color, chrome or B&W. Plenty of manual modes.\n\nMostly I like the size. It's not like trying to take a picture with a credit card which I find awkward. The grip is rubberized which makes it firm and easy to hold. Boots up and is ready to go in about 1 second. Memory card slot is separate from the battery compartment. \n\nDefinately a bang for the buck.",

Lens cap snaps on and off easily but must be attached to the strap. Where I naturally want to grip the camera with my left hand is right over the pop-up flash, guess I'll try and get used to it. \n\nI am going to keep playing with this but I'm betting I'll return it.

    "Cons": "Any negatives I have are more: \"I wish it had\" than real cons. \n\nI wish it had a \"bulb\" setting to give a little more creativity to the user. (it has a 4 sec. to 1/1000 shutter range)\nIf you don't want to use the large (2.5\") rear LCD, for framing your shots, it uses an eye level electronic view finder (EVF). Either of which are always on and can be a power usage concern - although, battery life was still pretty good. I used the camera on and off for a day and captured about 170 pix using 2400mAh batteries. \nI wish it had and optical eye level view finder, but then there would be parallax problems with the 10X zoom and the cost of linking the optics to the view finder would surely add a lot more to the price (keep saving for a DSLR if you want features like that).\nImage color is very good, but... areas of high contrast - say where the sky meets the trees - has some bluish purple fringing. Still, the images I took that were under even contrast or those at sunset were awesome!",
    "Pros": "Great  \"Prosumer\" dig. camera for the price (and it's now about a hundred $ less than last year's average price). \n\n7-megapixels, 10x optical zoom lens (38-380mm in 35mm equivalence), a lot of exposure modes, takes SD and xD cards, takes very good movies with sound (and you can even zoom while shooting movies).\nUses 4 AA batteries, so you're never far from spares (but get a set of 2400 NiMH rechargeable batteries for better use).\nIt can capture 3 frames in under 2 seconds in \"Top 3\"mode and continuously at about 2 second intervals in \"Long Period\" mode. \nA ISO range of 64 to 1600 (but shadows start to get a little noisey at 400 and highlights at 800).",
    "Comments": "One more (con?); the LCD or EyeVF blacks out in between shots (not in the burst mode, though). A little like closing your eyes when you press the shutter relese.\nBut again, it's providing a nearly SLR-like view finder for a lower price, I you want an SLR you'll have to pay about 4 times (starting price) than what you'll pay for this camera.\n\nThis would be great camera even if it cost a hundred $ more.",
