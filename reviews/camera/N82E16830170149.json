    "Pros": "It takes HD video, but don't forget you'll need Kodak's dock  (not a big deal, in fact a nice product).  The stills are excellent too, it's \"brainless\" mode picks the best setting for what it believes you're doing, and it does a fair job doing so.  It's price for a 12MP camera and HD video is pretty good.  The optical zoom is of great quality.",

Anything with less than super-saturated lighting (outdoors) will cause your images to lose all fine detail.  All indoor pictures, even when well-lit and with the flash on at modest distance (6 feet) will cause you to get more of an impressionist painting than a picture.  The pictures will be made up of small splotches of color, annihilating detail areas and edges.  Because of this, pet fur, hair, and other fine details are captured more as smudges than what they really are.  I tried to live with it, but this pitfall is proving most depressing.  I will probably be returning this model for something else.  I don't know what yet.",
    "Pros": "This camera is inexpensive for a 12MP camera, and it will take some decent quality outdoor shots.",
    "Comments": "If all you want is a point and shoot for preserving some memories and aren't concerned with viewing your images at 12MP (100% zoom), this might actually be a decent choice.  If you are interested in a high quality image indoors, look elsewhere.  If all you are interested in is mid-day outdoors shooting, this will also be an ok choice.  Overall though, the six year old 3.2MP Fuji A303 this was meant to replace does about the same quality of job, except for outdoor shots.  Please note that I know I don't just have a fluke unit--if you check shots from this model other people have put on the net, the same problems do manifest themselves in their images.",

Best choice is to get USB King$xxn SDHC card reader here on newegg which will make fast, seamless transfers and no lost pictures and you can use your favorite software to edit or print them.\nAlso it doesn't have case but with this price range I'm not surprised.",
