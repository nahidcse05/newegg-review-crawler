    "Pros": "Really nice looking pictures at 16 Mega Pixels. I mean REALLY nice! (at this price point)",
    "Comments": "Be certain to buy EXTRA MEMORY for this unit! \nNot sure what the maximum mem card allowed is (16 gig,.. 32 gig... who knows),. the specs are unclear. In fairness I have not been to the support site yet. But newegg should do that research for us, and have it posted here, for us lowly worker ant consumers.",
