    "Cons": "Power Button Is Hard To Hit At Times, especially for women with nails. \nOne VERY IRRITATING ISSUE is that when we plug the camera into the computer the camera shuts off making it impossible to transfer, I unplug it from the computer and it turns back on, plug it in and it shuts off. \nIn my mind this means the camera's broken, it worked at first, we were able to transfer about a dozen pictures, and works perfectly at all times except now when we plug it into USB it shuts off. When it is plugged into usb and we try to start it, it just cycles its startup screen, never fully powering on while connected to PC.. I'm very disappointed that Kodak would produce a camera with Problems like this. I will post a 2nd review if I find a way to resolve this problem, without this issue this Camera is a 4-5 egg Camera.",
    "Pros": "Great Camera, clear clean pictures of good quality, fast shutter time and great features.\nFeels Made Well. Nice Color. Nice Size. Fits well in both male and female hands. Easy to navigate after you use it for afew minutes.\n\nIf it 'worked as it should' it would be a 5 egg product, keep that in mind, This is a great camera if you get one that works all the way.\n\nAs Always, Newegg Shipping was awesome and fast.",
    "Comments": "Click the share button, then connect the Camera to your PC to see the camera turn off for no reason..\nNeed those pictures? Guess you better mount the SD card to an external reader. Other then that, good camera if you didn't buy it for its selling function, the Easy 'share' button.",
