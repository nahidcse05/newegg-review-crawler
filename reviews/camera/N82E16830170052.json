The bundle includes a Series 3 Kodak Photo Printer, Rechargeable batteries, the camera, connection cords and a 10-page sample pack of paper.  The camera charges when docked on the photo printer.  The prints are as good as film cameras and better than some of the prints you can have made at stores.  The charge on the batteries lasts for several hundred photos.  The camera is pretty simple to use even for a novice.  The menus are clear and understandable.  In night shots, the LCD displays grainy pictures, but when it flashes, the picture taken is clear.  You have the ability to customize settings (ISO Speed, White Balance, etc.) as you would on your film camera if you want.  Also, you can take a burst of images; either four at a time or three at a time.",
