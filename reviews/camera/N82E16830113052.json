    "LoginNickName": "Pete",
    "BoughtTimeTypeString": "1 month to 1 year",
    "TechLevelTypeString": "Somewhat High",
    "IsNewReview": true,
    "PurchaseMark": false,
    "Cons": "The only real con I have is that certain Nikon compatible AF lenses don't allow auto focus or auto metering. I own two older Quantarray AF Nikor lenses that I thought should work with the AF and meter systems, but neither do. Basically, if you have a collection of older Nikor AF lenses, I suggest testing them before you buy this camera. Honestly though, if you buy this camera you need to get the Nikor VR lenses, they are more than worth the money. All Nikor F mount lenses will work manually with this camera.",
    "Pros": "Very fast to start, very fast on shutter release. Metering and auto focus is spot on and works like a champ. Overall, this camera just works. For the beginner to advanced, it has all the features one could need to take stunning photographs. Well, other than any sort of artistic flair to bestow on the user.",
    "Comments": "This camera proves out the megapixels do not equal better pictures theory. The biggest difference between the D40 and the D40x is the image sensor size and speed. To put the bigger sensor into the camera, there is a sacrifice in the speed at which the sensor works. Essentially, the default ISO is 100 in the D40x and 200 in the D40, which directly affects sharpness of the resulting image (200 better than 100 in this case). Most part time photogs won't care, but if you really start to play with this camera, you may actually notice. I don't really care to be honest, this just lets me pick up an old hobby again (film is way to pricey). But for action, low light, or interesting lighting type scenes, you may wish you had the D40. Just FYI.",
