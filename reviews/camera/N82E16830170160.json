    "Cons": "The lens cap is a little (soft) and pops off too easily (I needed to add another set of springs to keep it on reliably)  I would have loved to have had a little more zoom added to this model ( I think I will be able to live without that).  The body is larger  than the z710,( but I guess I have to allow for more features).  My BIGGEST PROBLEM with the camera is that I can't remove the batteries without removing the camera from a tri-pod.  I am having a VERY hard time learning how to take pictures of the heavens, (maybe I need a little teaching) MY 2nd  largest problem with this camera, is that I can take SOOO many videos, and pictures that I like I have filled up a 200Gig partition on my hard drive.",
    "Pros": "Great resolution even in digital zoom.  The image stabilization is a fantastic upgrade to the z710.  I love the fact that they added continuous zoom to the video.  3 photo stitch is a BEAUTIFUL new toy for me to play with,I have a picture of something being held up in 3 places by one person.  I have perfect  pictures with baseballs, broken bats, and stopped chopper blades(NO blur).  the mod dial is still not near the shutter, or zoom so there aren't mistakes.",
    "Comments": "You can take many photos so you can get the one you like (want)..  You don't HAVE to have much photo knowledge at all to take great photos.  The insurance plan that I bought was a GREAT NECESSITY.  AND A GREAT thing to buy, I had a problem with my 1st camera, I called newegg and they told  me to send it back.  A new camera was not able to be acquired, so I was given the option of either getting something of similar value, OR a COMPLETE refund.  I bought 2 other brands similar, or upgraded cameras.  After 2 months of trying to find a replacement....I bought a refurbished model.   Buy this camera if you have room for a 35mm sized body body, with similar functions, but don't need to set everything.",

Go to Kodak website for more manual, or read a Canon/Nikon manual. The icons all work the same way. Bottom says designed in Japan, made in China.",
    "Pros": "Use American brand, with pride. Good picture quality. Large lens. 1-3/8 inch diameter. 12x optical zoom, beats any compact by several fold. Easy to focus, even when zoomed to max. Flash produces good lighting. Intuitive to use, after reading the 20 page manual. The lens is not changeable like a real SLR. But with 396mm zoom, there is no need to change lens. There is no need to bring a bag of lens. Very cheap for what you get.",
    "Comments": "The battery in the package is single use. I got a charger plus 2 Li-Ion rechargeable for $20. Works great. Box says INSTEN KOD 8000 charger 8980. Lens cap is a little annoying to deal with. But it does not impact picture quality.",

He has a buggy external memory card, because my write speed is FAST.\nImage stablization - wow, so intuitive helps correct those small hand movements when taking pictures to prevent fuzziness.\nAs a camera this thing is amazing on all ends. Creativity, quality, technology, and responsiveness.\nFeels great on the hand once you learn how to hold it.\nLens cap is awesome - don't forget to take it off when you power on your camera though because the lens extends from the camera, pushing it off.\nI suggest P mode which is auto smart picture mode, but with the added capability of changing focus modes (macro/landscape/manual/auto).\nAuto red eye remover in P and Auto mode - what more can you ask for?",
    "Comments": "Definitely read the manual - it's straight forward and intuitive.\nUltra quality camera for decent price, I think that's a deal no matter how you slice it.\nI wonder how sturdy this thing is though, it's actually a smaller camera than most, no bigger than half the size of the average hand. I feel like if I dropped it, forbid that happening, something would definitely break just because of how it's built. So keep a sturdy hold on the thing :)\nDefinitely recommended buy.",
