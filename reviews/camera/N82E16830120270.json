Another issue is with selection of settings.  Prior designs enabled selections by pressing the dial shaped buttons.  With the new design this dial now rotates and is harder to use.

    "Comments": "I tried to return this camera and wanted to buy a 780.  The 780 has a 3x and is a little more expensive for the rugged body and compactness. Ratings of 780 are better than the 890.  This would have cost me another $50 with buying the 780 and returning the 890.  Please look at the photos of the camera or the 360 view before buying.",

It has all the fun options of a canon, but you can really make some nice pictures with the manual setting.   I can sum up my love for this camera as follows.... I've lost this camera twice. I bought it when it first came out for $350, then got another one a year later for $200, and now Im going to get another.  I really do not feel the need for anything better than this.  If im gonna do a pro photoshoot ill use an SLR.   For anything low light to high speed activity 890IS all the way (dont be fooled by other models around it either, 970, 880, things like that, they dont come close)",

I've owned an sd1000 for about two years and the only thing I still wanted was a better zoom, so I got this one for  my girlfriend. Canon is so durable she dropped hers and its fine, I dropped mine in the water and it was fine after being dried in the sun, it's also been dragged through the dirt and stored in my pocket every day. Menus and functions are pretty intuitive, and much better than some other digital cameras.  The combination of Canon's lenses and a 10MP detector results in great looking pictures, even from a soccer field away.  Combined with a Canon printer, you can print good quality photos quickly with the push of a single button.",

CaseLogic makes a small neoprene case perfect for these cameras.  I commute everyday and these cameras have come in handy when other people run into my car.",

Also power botton is very small and impossible to press with my gloves on. choosing a setting on manual? forget it, use both hands. Placement of all bottons are not user friendly at all. Also, be aware that body heats up aft 5 minutes of continue operation (hand warmer anyone?) \n\nMy 2+ year old SD700 died, and I needed a new camera quick. I read SD890 replaced the 700, thou I read many bad reviews, but I didn't have time so I placed an order. I'm not too crazy about this model at all, I'd say stay away from this model, and wait for the next model to come out (if they ever make 10m 5x optical lens camera...)",

The sd890 is a little more flimsy and the power button is hard to depress, especially if you trying to take an unexpected pic. I do like the preview button, it is a simple button push to preview the pics you have taken. I would rate this as a 4.8 only becuase of what i hvae mentioned. The photo cababilities are top notch though. Easy point and click to get great shots",
